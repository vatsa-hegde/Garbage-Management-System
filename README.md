## 📖 Project Overview  
This system integrates **IoT hardware with ML-powered computer vision** to solve the challenge of efficient waste management.  

1. The **camera captures images** of incoming waste.  
2. A **machine learning algorithm (YOLOv3)** processes the image and classifies it into *Recycle, Trash, or Landfill*.  
3. Based on classification, the **Raspberry Pi controls motors** to move the waste item to the correct conveyor belt.  
4. **IR sensors** detect objects on the conveyor to start/stop its movement, ensuring efficiency and reducing energy consumption.  

This project demonstrates expertise in **IoT, hardware-software integration, machine learning, and computer vision applications** for real-world sustainability problems.
